## Project Description 

The purpose of this real time project is the construction of a simple electronic harp, where lasers will be used to simulate harp strings and pre-defined chords or notes corresponding to the appropriate strings will be played through the user audio output such as a monitor or USB speaker. 

The project will be undertaken in the C++ programming language and will use hardware such as a Raspberry Pi 4 .

## Project Aim and Objectives

### Project Aim
To develop an electronic harp that can play preselected notes or chords using a Raspberry Pi.

### Project Objectives

So that the development of the project is undertaken in an efficient manner the following objectives have been set out as good indicators to how the project should proceed. The objectives will be reviewed as the project progresses. 

<ol>
<li>Get 1 string working. </li>
<li>Get the remaining strings working. </li>
<li>Incorporate a way for the user to change notes or chords as they play. </li>
<li>Look at how to incorporate a Left-handed mode. </li>
<li>Develop efficient code in C++. </li>
<li>Document code throughout project. </li>
<li>Use version control throughout to track bugs, undertake revisions and test code. </li>
<li>Promote on GitHub, social media and through live demos. </li>
</ol>
